Using [Zymo *Quick*-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

Extracting DNA and RNA from juvenile oyster samples from multi-stressor exposure experiment.

Juveniles were collected individually in 1.5ml tubes, preserved with liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80 freezer until processing. 

This is the general protocol I followed for DNA/RNA Extractions adapted from [Amy Zyck's protcol](https://github.com/amyzyck/AmyZyck_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-01-RISG-Zymo-DNA%3ARNA-Extractions-of-Larval-Oyster-Samples.md). I typically processed 10-12 samples at a time. 

**Time to Completion: 6-8 hours (includes QC)**

### Homogenization 

- Turn on thermomixer and set to 55 degrees C, speed 1000 rpm
- Pull Proteinase K out of -20 freezer to warm to room temperature
- In 1.5 mL tubes, add 300 μL of DNA/RNA Shield
- Pull samples out of -80 freezer and put on ice
- Sterilize forceps with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAse Zap, and RNAse-free Water
- Sterilize forceps between each sample
- Using forceps, transfer juvenile to 1.5 mL tube with DNA/RNA Shield
- Sterilize cone-shaped dremmel bit with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAse Zap, and RNAse-free Water
- Sterilize the dremmel bit between each sample
- Insert dremmel bit into 1.5 mL tube with juvenile and grind up juvenile for ~10 seconds at speed 5
- Add 30 μL PK Digestion Buffer to each tube
- Add 15 μL Proteinase K
- Vortex and spin down
- Incubate in thermomixer at 55 degrees C and 1000 rpm for 30 minutes
- Halfway through incubation, spin down tubes in tabletop centrifuge for 1 minute at 13000 rpm

During incubation period:
- *Pull Biotium dsDNA and RNA kits out of fridge/freezer and put in drawer (light sensitive) to warm to room temperature*
- Prep and label all tubes for extraction protocol (for each tube type, multiply by number of samples being processed)

- Prep 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and RNAse-free Water for thermomixer
    - For each, 50 μL x # of samples (plus error) in 1.5 mL tubes
    - Put in thermomixer set to 70 degrees C
- Make DNAse reaction mix:
    - DNA Digestion Buffer: 75 μL x # of samples
    - DNAse I: 5 μL x # of samples
After incubation:
- Spin down tubes at max speed for 2 minutes in tabletop centrifuge
- Without disturbing the debris pellet, gently transfer all supernatant (~350 μL) to new 1.5 mL tube for DNA
- Save debris pellet and store in -20 freezer (can check for incomplete digestion later on if necessary)
- Add equal volume (300 μL) of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer to each tube
- Finger flick to mix
- Transfer all supernatant (~600 μL) to yellow spin-column
- Centrigue at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds
- Transfer flow-through to new 1.5 mL tube for RNA
