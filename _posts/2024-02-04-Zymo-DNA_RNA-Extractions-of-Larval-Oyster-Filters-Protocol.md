Using [Zymo *Quick*-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

Extracting DNA and RNA from larval oyster samples from multi-stressor exposure experiment and Vibrio challenges. 

Larvae were collected onto Pluri filters, preserved with liquid nitrogen, stored in Whirlpaks and held in a -80 freezer until processing. 

This is the general protocol I followed for DNA/RNA Extractions adapted from [Amy Zyck's protcol](https://github.com/amyzyck/AmyZyck_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-01-RISG-Zymo-DNA%3ARNA-Extractions-of-Larval-Oyster-Samples.md). I typically processed 10-12 samples at a time. 

**Time to Completion: 8-10 hours (includes QC)**

### Homogenization 
- In 50 mL falcon tubes, add **1000 μL** of ***DNA/RNA Shield*** (can be prepped the night before)
- Turn on Incubator Genie and set to 55 degrees C, rocking speed 35
- Pull Proteinase K out of -20 freezer to warm to room temperature 
- Sterilize scalpel blade with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAseZap, and RNAse-free Water
    - Repeat the sterilization between each sample
- Take samples out of -80 freezer one at a time 
- Place filter on open falcon tube, and cut a cross section through the filter then cut the perimeter of the filter 
    - Make sure all pieces of the filter fall into the falcon tube and are submerged in DNA/RNA Shield
- Add **100 μL** of ***PK Digestion Buffer (kit)*** to each tube
- Add **50 μL** ***Proteinase K*** to each tube and vortex to mix 
- Incubate tubes in Incubator Genie at 55 degrees C, rocking speed 35 for 2.5 hours 
    - Vortex the tubes every 30 minutes
- During incubation period: 
    - Prep and label all tubes for extraction protocol (for each tube type, multiply by number of samples being processed)

    - Prepare stock of ***10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0*** in a falcon tube (if not already done)

        - **19.8 ml** Nuclease free water
        - **200 μL** 1M Tris HCl pH 8.0
    - Prep ***10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0*** (from prepped falcon tube) and ***RNAse-free Water*** for thermomixer 
        - For each, 100 μL x # of samples (plus error) in 1.5 mL tubes 
        - Put in thermomixer and set to 70 degrees C 
    - Make ***DNAse reaction mix***:
