Using [Zymo *Quick*-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit)

Extracting DNA from juvenile oyster samples from multi-stressor exposure experiment.

Juveniles were collected individually in 1.5ml tubes, preserved with liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80 freezer until processing. 

This is the general protocol I followed for DNA Extractions adapted from [dual DNA/RNA extraction protcol](https://mguid73.github.io/MEGPuritz_Lab_Notebook/Zymo-DNA_RNA-Extractions-of-Juvenile-Oysters-Protocol/). I typically processed 10-12 samples at a time. 

**Time to Completion: TBD hours (includes QC)**

### Prep tubes
Prep and label all tubes for extraction protocol (for each tube type, multiply by number of samples being processed)

|tube                                         |purpose                      |number           |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
|1.5 mL                                       |homogenization/digest tube   | * (# of samples)|
|1.5 mL                                       |intmed. DNA steps            | * (# of samples)|
|Yellow spin-column & collection tubes        |DNA purificiation            | * (# of samples)|
|1.5 mL                                       |final DNA sample             | * (# of samples)|

### Homogenization 
- Turn on thermomixer and set to 55 degrees C, speed 1000 rpm
- Pull ***Proteinase K*** out of -20 freezer to warm to room temperature 
- *Pull Biotium dsDNA kit out of fridge/freezer and put in drawer (light sensitive) to warm to room temperature*
- In homogenization/digest tubes, add 300 μL of DNA/RNA Shield
- Pull samples out of -80 freezer and put on ice
- Sterilize forceps with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAse Zap, and RNAse-free Water
- Sterilize forceps between each sample
- Using forceps, transfer juvenile to 1.5 mL tube with DNA/RNA Shield
- Sterilize cone-shaped dremmel bit with 100% EtOH, Type II DI Water, RNAse Zap, and RNAse-free Water
- Sterilize the dremmel bit between each sample
- Insert dremmel bit into 1.5 mL tube with juvenile and grind up juvenile for ~10 seconds at speed 5
- Add **150 μL** of ***Solid Tissue Buffer*** to each tube
- Add **10 μL** of ***Proteinase K***
- Vortex and spin down
- Put in thermomixer at 55 degrees C, shaking at 1000 rpm for 30 minutes
    - Halfway through, spin down in tabletop centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 minute

**During incubation period:**
- Prep 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 for thermomixer
    - 50 μL x # of samples (plus error) in 1.5 mL tubes
    - Put in thermomixer set to 70 degrees C

**After incubation:**
- Spin down tubes at max speed for 2 minutes in tabletop centrifuge
- Without disturbing the debris pellet, gently transfer all supernatant (~450 μL) to *new 1.5 mL tube (intmed. DNA step)*
- Save debris pellet and store in -20 freezer (can check for incomplete digestion later on if necessary)

#### DNA Purification 
- Add **400 μL** of ***Genomic Binding Buffer*** to each *intmed. DNA tube*
- Vortex and spin down
- Add **800 μL** of supernatant to *yellow spin-column*
- Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 minute
- Discard flow-through
- Transfer spin-columns to new collection tube?????????????????????????
- Add **400 μL** of ***DNA Pre-Wash Buffer*** to spin-column
- Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 minute
- Discard flow-through
- Add **700 μL** of ***g-DNA Wash Buffer***
- Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 minute
- Discard flow-through
- Add **200 μL** of ***g-DNA Wash Buffer***
- Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 2 minutes; discard flow-through
- Transfer *spin-column* to *final DNA 1.5 mL tube*
- Carefully drip **50 μL** of warmed ***10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0*** directly onto filter
- *Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes*
- Centrifuge at 16000 rpm for 30 seconds and discard spin column
- ***Should have 50 μL of DNA***


#### Quality Control Check 

**Qubit**
- DNA concentrations are checked using the Biotium [dsDNA Broad Range](https://biotium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PI-31069.pdf) quantitation kit
- use 1 μL of sample for each of the assays (unless you need to use more)
- Final DNA and RNA concentrations (ng/μL) can be accessed [here]()

**Agarose Gel**
- DNA quality is checked using an [Agarose Gel](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol), following the protocol for a Small 1% gel run
- use 1uL DNA diluted in 4uL nuclease free water + 1uL loading dye for sample wells
- 100 V for 1 hr (60A)
- Sample gel can be accessed [here]()
